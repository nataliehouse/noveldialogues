1,"“The mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“Your mother keeps well?”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“Rotten little bounder too!”,John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“I can tell you, Hastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie—you remember Evie?”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“No.”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She’s the mater’s factotum, companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport—old Evie! Not precisely young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“You were going to say——?”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie’s, though she didn’t seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He’s got a great black beard, and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned to him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always running a hundred societies?”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is! It’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but there you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“It must be a difficult situation for you all.”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,“Difficult! It’s damnable!”,John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“Mainly owing to the mater’s activities.”,John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“I’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“My dear fellow, that’s just what I want.”",Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“Oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife works regularly ‘on the land’. She is up at five every morning to milk, and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It’s a jolly good life taking it all round—if it weren’t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“I wonder if we’ve time to pick up Cynthia. No, she’ll have started from the hospital by now.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“Cynthia! That’s not your wife?”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“No, Cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s, the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Hullo, Evie, here’s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings—Miss Howard.”",John Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,"“Hullo, Evie, here’s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings—Miss Howard.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“Weeds grow like house afire. Can’t keep even with ’em. Shall press you in. Better be careful.”,Evelyn Howard,John Cavendish
1,“Weeds grow like house afire. Can’t keep even with ’em. Shall press you in. Better be careful.”,Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“I’m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,”",Arthur Hastings,Evelyn Howard
1,“Don’t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn’t later.”,Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“You’re a cynic, Evie,”",John Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,“Where’s tea to-day—inside or out?”,John Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,“Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.”,Evelyn Howard,John Cavendish
1,"“Come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘The labourer is worthy of his hire’, you know. Come and be refreshed.”",John Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,"“Well,”",Evelyn Howard,John Cavendish
1,“I’m inclined to agree with you.”,Evelyn Howard,John Cavendish
1,"“My wife, Hastings,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Then you’ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I’ll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there’s the Duchess—about the school fête.”",Emily Inglethorp,Alfred Inglethorp
1,"“Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful, Alfred dear.”",Emily Inglethorp,Alfred Inglethorp
1,"“Why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings—my husband.”",Emily Inglethorp,Alfred Inglethorp
1,"“Why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings—my husband.”",Emily Inglethorp,Arthur Hastings
1,"“This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.”",Alfred Inglethorp,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Emily dearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.”",Alfred Inglethorp,Emily Inglethorp
1,"“Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?”",Alfred Inglethorp,Arthur Hastings
1,"“No, before the war I was in Lloyd’s.”",Arthur Hastings,Alfred Inglethorp
1,“And you will return there after it is over?”,Alfred Inglethorp,Arthur Hastings
1,“Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.”,Arthur Hastings,Alfred Inglethorp
1,"“What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just consult your inclination?”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Well, that depends.”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
1,“No secret hobby?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“Tell me—you’re drawn to something? Everyone is—usually something absurd.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“You’ll laugh at me.”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
1,“Perhaps.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Well, I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
1,“The real thing—Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous detective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow. He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method. My system is based on his—though of course I have progressed rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully clever.”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
1,"“Like a good detective story myself,”",Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Lots of nonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone dumbfounded. Real crime—you’d know at once.”",Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,”",Arthur Hastings,Evelyn Howard
1,"“Don’t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The family. You couldn’t really hoodwink them. They’d know.”",Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Then,”",Arthur Hastings,Evelyn Howard
1,"“you think that if you were mixed up in a crime, say a murder, you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?”",Arthur Hastings,Evelyn Howard
1,“Of course I should. Mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers. But I’m certain I’d know. I’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near me.”,Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“It might be a ‘she’,”",Arthur Hastings,Evelyn Howard
1,“Might. But murder’s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.”,Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,“Not in a case of poisoning.”,Mary Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,"“Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession, there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.”",Mary Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,"“Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!”",Emily Inglethorp,Mary Cavendish
1,"“It makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there’s Cynthia!”",Emily Inglethorp,Mary Cavendish
1,"“Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings—Miss Murdoch.”",Emily Inglethorp,Cynthia Murdoch
1,"“Sit down here on the grass, do. It’s ever so much nicer.”",Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
1,"“You work at Tadminster, don’t you, Miss Murdoch?”",Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
1,“For my sins.”,Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Do they bully you, then?”",Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
1,“I should like to see them!”,Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
1,"“I have got a cousin who is nursing,”",Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
1,“And she is terrified of ‘Sisters’.”,Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
1,"“I don’t wonder. Sisters are, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly are! You’ve no idea! But I’m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the dispensary.”",Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
1,“How many people do you poison?”,Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
1,"“Oh, hundreds!”",Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Cynthia,”",Emily Inglethorp,Cynthia Murdoch
1,“do you think you could write a few notes for me?”,Emily Inglethorp,Cynthia Murdoch
1,"“Certainly, Aunt Emily.”",Cynthia Murdoch,Emily Inglethorp
1,"“John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member’s wife—she was the late Lord Abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same. She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a war household; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper, even, is saved and sent away in sacks.”",Emily Inglethorp,Arthur Hastings
1,“Cynthia”,Emily Inglethorp,Cynthia Murdoch
1,"“Look here, Mary, there’s the deuce of a mess. Evie’s had a row with Alfred Inglethorp, and she’s off.”",John Cavendish,Mary Cavendish
1,“Evie? Off?”,Mary Cavendish,John Cavendish
1,"“Yes; you see she went to the mater, and—Oh,—here’s Evie herself.”",John Cavendish,Mary Cavendish
1,"“At any rate,”",Evelyn Howard,Mary Cavendish
1,“I’ve spoken my mind!”,Evelyn Howard,Mary Cavendish
1,"“My dear Evelyn,”",Mary Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,“this can’t be true!”,Mary Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,"“True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won’t forget or forgive in a hurry. Don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. Probably water off a duck’s back, though. I said right out: ‘You’re an old woman, Emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool. The man’s twenty years younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he married you for. Money! Well, don’t let him have too much of it. Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much time he spends over there.’ She was very angry. Natural! I went on, ‘I’m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He’s a bad lot. You can say what you like to me, but remember what I’ve told you. He’s a bad lot!’”",Evelyn Howard,Mary Cavendish
1,“What did she say?”,Mary Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,“‘Darling Alfred’—‘dearest Alfred’—‘wicked calumnies’ —‘wicked lies’—‘wicked woman’—to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ The sooner I left her house the better. So I’m off.”,Evelyn Howard,Mary Cavendish
1,“But not now?”,Mary Cavendish,Evelyn Howard
1,“This minute!”,Evelyn Howard,Mary Cavendish
1,"“Mr. Hastings, you’re honest. I can trust you?”",Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They’re a lot of sharks—all of them. Oh, I know what I’m talking about. There isn’t one of them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I’ve protected her as much as I could. Now I’m out of the way, they’ll impose upon her.”",Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Of course, Miss Howard,”",Arthur Hastings,Evelyn Howard
1,"“I’ll do everything I can, but I’m sure you’re excited and overwrought.”",Arthur Hastings,Evelyn Howard
1,"“Young man, trust me. I’ve lived in the world rather longer than you have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You’ll see what I mean.”",Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil—her husband!”",Evelyn Howard,Arthur Hastings
1,“Who is that?”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“That’s Dr. Bauerstein,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“And who is Dr. Bauerstein?”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“He’s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous breakdown. He’s a London specialist; a very clever man—one of the greatest living experts on poisons, I believe.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“And he’s a great friend of Mary’s,”",Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She always had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England than Evelyn Howard.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“That’s a pretty girl,”",Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,“That is Mrs. Raikes.”,John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“The one that Miss Howard——”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“Exactly,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Styles is really a glorious old place,”",Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“Yes, it’s a fine property. It’ll be mine some day—should be mine now by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I shouldn’t be so damned hard up as I am now.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,"“Hard up, are you?”",Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“My dear Hastings, I don’t mind telling you that I’m at my wits’ end for money.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
1,“Couldn’t your brother help you?”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
1,"“Lawrence? He’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings. No, we’re an impecunious lot. My mother’s always been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since her marriage, of course——”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
2,"“Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster’s sister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror—one of our oldest families.”",Emily Inglethorp,Arthur Hastings
2,“Nibs.”,Cynthia Murdoch,Nibs
2,“What a lot of bottles!”,Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
2,“Do you really know what’s in them all?”,Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
2,"“Say something original,”",Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
2,“Every single person who comes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does not say: ‘What a lot of bottles!’ And I know the next thing you’re going to say is: ‘How many people have you poisoned?’”,Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
2,"“If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by mistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. Come on, let’s have tea. We’ve got all sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. No, Lawrence—that’s the poison cupboard. The big cupboard—that’s right.”",Cynthia Murdoch,Lawrence Cavendish

2,"“Well,”",Cynthia Murdoch,Nurse
2,"“we are very busy, but if we have time it shall be done.”",Cynthia Murdoch,Nurse
2,“Discipline must be maintained?”,Arthur Hastings,Cynthia Murdoch
2,“Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside wards there.”,Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
2,"“Nothing more to do, Nibs?”",Cynthia Murdoch,Nibs
2,“No.”,Nibs,Cynthia Murdoch
2,“All right. Then we can lock up and go.”,Cynthia Murdoch,Nibs

2,“But I had no idea he was a friend of yours.”,Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings

2,“I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.”,Hercule Poirot,Cynthia Murdoch
2,"“Yes, my friend, she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her with gratitude.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

2,"“Don’t you think, m’m, you’d better get to bed? You’re looking very tired.”",Dorcas,Emily Inglethorp
2,"“Perhaps you’re right, Dorcas—yes—no—not now. I’ve some letters I must finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told you?”",Emily Inglethorp,Dorcas
2,"“Yes, m’m.”",Dorcas,Emily Inglethorp
2,“Then I’ll go to bed directly after supper.”,Emily Inglethorp,Dorcas

3,“what ever shall we do?”,Dorcas,John Cavendish
3,"“We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It’ll be a tough job, though. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him to go for Dr. Wilkins at once.

4,“About eight o’clock.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not much later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects would be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs. Inglethorp’s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o’clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about the same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to that extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But, according to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious circumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it. In the meantime, remember it.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

4,"“Yes, sir. But I don’t know that I ought——”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying your mistress’s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary that we should know all—if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the murderer to justice.”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Amen to that,”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“And, naming no names, there’s one in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it was when first he darkened the threshold.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot

4,"“Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“What time was that?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“I couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way. Perhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I said, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and angry in here. I didn’t exactly mean to listen, but—well, there it is. I stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. ‘You have lied to me, and deceived me,’ she said. I didn’t hear what Mr. Inglethorp replied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered: ‘How dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe everything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace upon our name!’ Again I didn’t hear what he said, but she went on: ‘Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty clearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ Then I thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp’s voice you heard?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Well, what happened next?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o’clock, Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful—so white and upset. ‘Dorcas,’ she says, ‘I’ve had a great shock.’ ‘I’m sorry for that, m’m,’ I says. ‘You’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea, m’m.’ She had something in her hand. I don’t know if it was a letter, or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept staring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written there. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was there: ‘These few words—and everything’s changed.’ And then she says to me: ‘Never trust a man, Dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ I hurried off, and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said she’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘I don’t know what to do,’ she says. ‘Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas. I’d rather hush it up if I could.’ Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so she didn’t say any more.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Yes, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Well, I don’t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“Is that where she usually kept important papers?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up every night.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“When did she lose the key of it?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look carefully for it. She was very much put out about it.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“But she had a duplicate key?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Oh, yes, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key that was lost?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“That’s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked everywhere for it.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“No, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“Are you quite sure?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Oh, yes, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,“Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.”,Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“Light or dark green?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“No, sir—not that I know of.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Not last night, sir, I know she didn’t.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“Why do you know so positively?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she didn’t have any more made up.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“You are quite sure of that?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Positive, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to sign any paper yesterday?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“To sign a paper? No, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they found your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“I’m afraid I couldn’t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie could tell you, though she’s a careless girl. Never cleared the coffee-cups away last night. That’s what happens when I’m not here to look after things.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray you. I should like to examine them.”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Very well, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“What time did you go out last evening?”,Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“About six o’clock, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“I have been admiring these flower beds. How many gardeners are employed here, by the way?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as a gentleman’s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir. A fair sight it was. But now there’s only old Manning, and young William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like. Ah, these are dreadful times!”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,"“The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now, will you send Annie to me here?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
4,"“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
4,“How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,“And about the lost key and the duplicate?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,“Where did you find it?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,“In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom. It was Number Six of my catalogue.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of much importance?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar about this box?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“No, I can’t say that I do.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,“Look at the label.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“‘One powder to be taken at bedtime, if required. Mrs. Inglethorp.’ No, I see nothing unusual.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,“Not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,“Ah!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“To be sure, that is odd!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his printed name?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“No, I can’t say that I have.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my friend.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many were there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don’t think I remember, sir—oh, yes, one was to Ross’s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other one, I don’t remember.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Think,”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“I’m sorry, sir, but it’s clean gone. I don’t think I can have noticed it.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“It does not matter,”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,“Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have that every night?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up in the night—whenever she fancied it.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“What was it? Plain cocoa?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“Who took it to her room?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“I did, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“Always?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Yes, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“At what time?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“No, sir, you see there’s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used to make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I used to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and take it into her room later.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Yes, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the farther—servants’ side?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“It’s this side, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“What time did you bring it up last night?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o’clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came up to bed before I’d finished.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing on the table in the left wing?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Yes, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“And if there was salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. I never took the salt near it.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“What makes you think there was salt in it?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Seeing it on the tray, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“You saw some salt on the tray?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took the tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress’s room I saw it at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and asked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was out, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took it in.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into Miss Cynthia’s room bolted?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“And the door into Mr. Inglethorp’s room? Did you notice if that was bolted too?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“I couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn’t say whether it was bolted or not.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door after you?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it at night. The door into the passage, that is.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room yesterday?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only a reading-lamp.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor, you think you would have been sure to have seen it?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper and a hot iron.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“Did your mistress ever have a green dress?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“No, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,"“Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports coat?”",Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Not green, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“Nor anyone else in the house?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“No, sir.”",Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“You are sure of that?”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,“Quite sure.”,Annie,Hercule Poirot
4,“Bien! That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.”,Hercule Poirot,Annie
4,"“Poirot,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,“I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,“What is a great discovery?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That explains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early morning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“So you think that the cocoa—mark well what I say, Hastings, the cocoa—contained strychnine?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“It might have been salt,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“You are not pleased with me, mon ami?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“My dear Poirot,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“it is not for me to dictate to you. You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,"“A most admirable sentiment,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the smaller desk in the corner?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,“Mr. Inglethorp’s.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
4,“Ah!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,“Locked. But perhaps one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s keys would open it.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“Voilà! It is not the key, but it will open it at a pinch.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“Decidedly, he is a man of method, this Mr. Inglethorp!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,"“There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, mon ami? There might have been? Yes”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
4,“this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much. Only this.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Where did you find this?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp’s. But what does it mean?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“I cannot say—but it is suggestive.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Come,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“now to examine the coffee-cups!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know about the cocoa?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Oh, là là! That miserable cocoa!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“And, anyway,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“as Mrs. Inglethorp took her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to find, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Come, come, my friend,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Ne vous fâchez pas! Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I will respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out. Yes. Then she came across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here are the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s. And the one on the tray?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“John Cavendish’s. I saw him put it down there.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Good. One, two, three, four, five—but where, then, is the cup of Mr. Inglethorp?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“He does not take coffee.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Bien!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“It is evident! I had an idea—but clearly I was mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no matter!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Breakfast is ready,”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“May I ask how things are proceeding?”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“Do your investigations point to my mother having died a natural death—or—or must we prepare ourselves for the worst?”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“I think, Mr. Cavendish,”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views of the other members of the family?”,Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure.”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“He does, does he? That is very interesting—very interesting,”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“And Mrs. Cavendish?”,Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“I have not the least idea what my wife’s views on the subject are.”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“I told you, didn’t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“It’s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him as usual—but, hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer!”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr. Cavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp’s reason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had forgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“Yes.”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key was forgotten—that he did not take it after all?”,Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the hall drawer. I’ll go and see if it’s there now.”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would find it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to replace it by now.”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“But do you think——”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his favour. That is all.”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,"“Do not worry,”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,"“I assure you that you need not let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some breakfast.”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,"“Yes, I’ve got the most beastly headache.”",Cynthia Murdoch,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?”",Hercule Poirot,Cynthia Murdoch
5,“It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the mal de tête.”,Hercule Poirot,Cynthia Murdoch
5,"“No sugar,”",Cynthia Murdoch,Hercule Poirot
5,"“No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?”",Hercule Poirot,Cynthia Murdoch
5,"“No, I never take it in coffee.”",Cynthia Murdoch,Hercule Poirot
5,“Sacré!”,Hercule Poirot,Cynthia Murdoch
5,"“Mr. Wells to see you, sir,”",Dorcas,John Cavendish
5,“Show him into my study.”,John Cavendish,Dorcas
5,"“My mother’s lawyer,”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot

5,"“My mother’s lawyer,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
5,“He is also Coroner—you understand. Perhaps you would like to come with me?”,John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
5,“There will be an inquest then?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“What is it? You are not attending to what I say.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“It is true, my friend. I am much worried.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Why?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“What? You cannot be serious?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not understand. My instinct was right.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“What instinct?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups. Chut! no more now!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“You will understand, Wells,”",John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,“that this is all strictly private. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind.”,John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“Quite so, quite so,”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“Yes, I suppose so.”",John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“Indeed,”",John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“Shall we have to appear as witnesses—all of us, I mean?”",John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“You, of course—and ah—er—Mr.—er—Inglethorp.”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of form.”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,“I see.”,John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“If you know of nothing to the contrary,”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“I had thought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor’s report. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,“Yes.”,John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,“Then that arrangement will suit you?”,Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,“Perfectly.”,John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this most tragic affair.”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“I?”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should have received the letter this morning.”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,"“I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance.”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,“She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,"“Unfortunately, no.”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“That is a pity,”",John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“A great pity,”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,"“Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you—that is, if it is not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs. Inglethorp’s death, who would inherit her money?”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,"“The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish does not object——”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Not at all,”",John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her last will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant legacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson, Mr. John Cavendish.”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Was not that—pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish—rather unfair to her other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,"“No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father’s will, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother’s death, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep up Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law that will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,"“As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null and void.”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,“Hein!”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“Was Mrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“I do not know. She may have been.”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“She was,”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“We were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say ‘her last will.’ Had Mrs. Inglethorp, then, made several former wills?”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,"“On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“She was given to changing her mind as to her testamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of her family.”",Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Suppose,”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,"“that, unknown to you, she had made a new will in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a member of the family—we will say Miss Howard, for instance—would you be surprised?”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“Not in the least.”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,“Ah!”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss Howard?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“No.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Then why did you ask?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“Hush!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my mother’s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself.”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Which simplifies matters very much,”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“As technically, of course, he was entitled——”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important papers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through carefully.”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Yes,”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,“it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession.”,Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,“There is a later will.”,Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“There is a later will.”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“What?”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“What?”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Or, rather,”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“there was one.”,Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,"“Or, rather,”",Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“there was one.”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“What do you mean—there was one? Where is it now?”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,“Burnt!”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“Burnt?”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,“Yes. See here.”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“But possibly this is an old will?”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,“I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon.”,Hercule Poirot,Mr. Wells
5,“What?”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“Impossible!”,Mr. Wells,Hercule Poirot
5,"“If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to you.”",Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,"“Oh, of course—but I don’t see——”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.”,Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“Very well.”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.”",John Cavendish,Dorcas
5,"“Yes, sir.”",Dorcas,John Cavendish

5,“I want to speak to you.”,John Cavendish,Manning
5,"“Manning,”",John Cavendish,Manning

5,"“Yes, sir, she did.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like—I don’t know what exactly—she wrote it down for him.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“Well?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“Well, he did, sir.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“And what happened next?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning

5,“Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“And then?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper—under where she’d signed.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“And you signed where she told you?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“What did she do with it afterwards?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“What time was it when she first called you?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“About four, I should say, sir.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,“Not earlier? Couldn’t it have been about half-past three?”,Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,"“No, I shouldn’t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after four—not before it.”",Manning,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Thank you, Manning, that will do,”",Hercule Poirot,Manning
5,“Good heavens!”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“What an extraordinary coincidence.”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,“How—a coincidence?”,Hercule Poirot,John Cavendish
5,“That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!”,John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot

5,“What do you mean?”,John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with—someone yesterday afternoon——”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,“What do you mean?”,John Cavendish,Mr. Wells
5,"“In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never know. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she would have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. The will disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish, I much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”",Mr. Wells,John Cavendish
5,"“Suggestive, or not,”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
5,"“we are most grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur, what first led you to suspect the fact?”",John Cavendish,Hercule Poirot

5,"“you’ve been listening to the doctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all—or just enough to make them dangerous. I ought to know—my own father was a doctor. That little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever seen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he’d murder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he’s done it.

She never let people forget what she had done for them—and, that way she missed love. Don’t think she ever realized it, though, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different footing. I took my stand from the first. ‘So many pounds a year I’m worth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides—not a pair of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ She didn’t understand—was very offended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn’t that—but I couldn’t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the whole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion go for nothing.”",Evelyn Howard,Hercule Poirot

5,"“There was something in that case—some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime.

Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it, thus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have been something of great importance.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

5,"“Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it myself.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“They have made one more discovery, là-bas,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Mr. Wells told me as we were going upstairs.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“What was it?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs. Inglethorp’s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred Inglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged. It came quite as a surprise to Wells—and to John Cavendish also. It was written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the servants—not Dorcas.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“He says not.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“One might take that with a grain of salt,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Mon ami, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to see if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You will notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and subsequently with two—correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it in a sentence, thus: ‘I am possessed.’ Now, what did that tell me? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word ‘possessed’ that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind, the possibility of a will—(a document almost certain to contain that word)—occurred to me at once. This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they had been planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly both of the gardeners—for there were two sets of footprints in the bed—had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window, and they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right in my supposition.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“That was very ingenious,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Another point—how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had been lost?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Yes,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“You are very sure of his guilt?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“On the contrary,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“there are several points in his favour.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Oh, come now!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“Yes.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“I see only one.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“And that?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“That he was not in the house last night.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“‘Bad shot!’ as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to my mind tells against him.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“How is that?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last night, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His excuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two possibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a reason of his own for his absence.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“And that reason?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp, I should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel—but that does not of necessity make him a murderer.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“We do not agree, eh?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Well, let us leave it. Time will show which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the case. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“Well——”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“One must look at it logically.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“True.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“I should put it this way. The doors were bolted—our own eyes have told us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and the destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone entered the room. You agree so far?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Well,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“as the person who entered did not do so by the window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would naturally open the door to her own husband.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room—a most unusual proceeding on her part—she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs. Inglethorp herself?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards morning, and bolted it then.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another feature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“I had forgotten that,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“That is as enigmatical as ever. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and reticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was certainly not her affair.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to do.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“It is certainly curious,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Still, it is unimportant, and need not be taken into account.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory—let the theory go.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Well, we shall see,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Yes, we shall see.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Look, Poirot!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“Tiens!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist’s shop. He is coming here.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“A little minute,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“I come.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Oh, Mr. Poirot, I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that you’d just come back from the Hall?”",Albert Mace,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Yes, we have.”",Hercule Poirot,Albert Mace
5,“It’s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly. They do say—”,Albert Mace,Hercule Poirot
5,“that it’s poison?”,Albert Mace,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.”",Hercule Poirot,Albert Mace
5,"“Yes, exactly—of course——”",Albert Mace,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn’t—it isn’t strychnine, is it?”",Albert Mace,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Yes,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“He will have evidence to give at the inquest.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Not now, not now, mon ami. I have need of reflection. My mind is in some disorder—which is not well.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and classified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear yet—no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles me. Me, Hercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“And what are they?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very important.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“But it was a glorious day!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Poirot, you’re pulling my leg!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not forget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“And the second point?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“I am absolutely serious, my friend.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“But this is childish!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“No, it is very momentous.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“And supposing the Coroner’s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder against Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,"“They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire. Also,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“I should not allow it!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,“You would not allow it?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
5,“No.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Oh, yes, mon ami, I would do what I say.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs. Inglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved—no. But she was very good to us Belgians—I owe her a debt.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
5,"“Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let Alfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested now—when a word from me could save him!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
6,"“You’m from the Hall, bain’t you?”",Aged Rustic,Arthur Hastings
6,“Yes. I’m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked this way.”,Arthur Hastings,Aged Rustic
6,“A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies from the village?”,Aged Rustic,Arthur Hastings
6,"“Yes,”",Arthur Hastings,Aged Rustic
6,"“He has been here, then?”",Arthur Hastings,Aged Rustic
6,"“Oh, ay, he’s been here, right enough. More’n once too. Friend of yours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall—you’m a pretty lot!”",Aged Rustic,Arthur Hastings
6,"“Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?”",Arthur Hastings,Aged Rustic
6,"“One does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal gentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I’m sure.”",Aged Rustic,Arthur Hastings
6,“Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?”,Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,"“I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for domestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions placed on its sale.”",Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison was administered?”,Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,“No.”,Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,"“You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?”",Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,"“That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I hurried there as fast as I could.”",Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?”,Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,"“I entered Mrs. Inglethorp’s room. She was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out: ‘Alfred—Alfred——’”",Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp’s after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?”,Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,"“Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It is retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to have been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o’clock, whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening.”",Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in that?”,Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,"“No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed. There was no strychnine present.”",Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“How did you know?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
6,“Listen.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
6,“I should say”,Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“that I would have been considerably surprised at any other result.”,Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“Why?”,Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,"“Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be detected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be disguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it.”",Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine.”,Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,"“Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the coffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.”",Coroner,Dr. Bauerstein
6,"“Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of analyzing its contents.”",Dr. Bauerstein,Coroner
6,“I should like to make a suggestion if I may?”,Lawrence Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this matter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.”",Coroner,Lawrence Cavendish
6,"“It is just an idea of mine,”",Lawrence Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“Of course I may be quite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother’s death might be accounted for by natural means.”",Lawrence Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?”",Coroner,Lawrence Cavendish
6,"“My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was taking a tonic containing strychnine.”",Lawrence Cavendish,Coroner
6,“Ah!”,Coroner,Lawrence Cavendish
6,"“I believe,”",Lawrence Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by causing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident?”",Lawrence Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.”",Coroner,Lawrence Cavendish
6,"“What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell you the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison, but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is absurd.”",Dr. Wilkins,Coroner
6,“And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose?”,Coroner,Dr. Wilkins
6,"“Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs. Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time, as she dealt with Coot’s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.”",Dr. Wilkins,Coroner
6,“Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her death?”,Coroner,Dr. Wilkins
6,“Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.”,Dr. Wilkins,Coroner
6,"“That, of course, is always possible,”",Dr. Wilkins,Coroner
6,“That would have been the table by the bed?”,Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,"“I opened my door,”",Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“and listened. In a few minutes a bell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and we all went to my mother-in-law’s room, but it was locked——”",Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,“I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before.”,Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,“I?”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“Yes. I understand,”",Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,"“that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir. That is so, is it not?”",Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,"“Yes, that is so.”",Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“And the boudoir window was open, was it not?”",Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,“Yes.”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as they were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where you were than in the hall.”",Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,“Possibly.”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,“Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?”,Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,“I really do not remember hearing anything.”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,“Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?”,Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,"“Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.”",Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,“I am not in the habit of listening to private conversations.”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,"“And you remember nothing at all? Nothing, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it was a private conversation?”",Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,“Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something—I do not remember exactly what—about causing scandal between husband and wife.”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,“Ah!”,Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,"“That corresponds with what Dorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it was a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where you were?”",Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,“No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,“And that is all you can tell us?”,Coroner,Mary Cavendish
6,“That is all.”,Mary Cavendish,Coroner
6,“You did not hear the table fall?”,Coroner,Cynthia Murdoch

6,“It shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she’d been made a fool of!”,Evelyn Howard,Coroner

7,"“so far, we’ve only seen the case from the outside. That’s where the Yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of this kind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A lot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that’s where Mr. Poirot’s had the start of us. We shouldn’t have been here as soon as this even, if it hadn’t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you’ve been on the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little hints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary I’d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn’t bring it in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if it hadn’t been for the Coroner—he seemed to be holding them back.”",Inspector Japp,Hercule Poirot

I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the present, but what you say is very just—the word of a Belgian policeman, whose day is past, is not enough!

7,"“H’m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend himself except by silence?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

7,"“Yes, yes, too conclusive,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be examined—sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my friend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured—so cleverly that it has defeated its own ends.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,“How do you make that out?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible, it was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who sets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying goes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a fool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village chemist’s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not employ the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence—no shadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist’s assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

7,"“Neither do I see. I tell you, mon ami, it puzzles me. Me—Hercule Poirot!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the strychnine?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,“Very simply. He did not buy it.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,“But Mace recognized him!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr. Inglethorp’s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in Mr. Inglethorp’s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a man whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you remember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs. Inglethorp dealt principally with Coot’s in Tadminster.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,“Then you think——”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“Mon ami, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave the first one for the moment, what was the second?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,“Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or Lawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“No,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,“Of course an actor——”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they are both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain initial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all that is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his eyes—those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now, what is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from himself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand. Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt. It was a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof—such as the actual buying of the poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr. Inglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in his clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred Inglethorp?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“It may be so,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“But, if that was the case, why does he not say where he was at six o’clock on Monday evening?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“Ah, why indeed?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“If he were arrested, he probably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make him see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something discreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is, nevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal, quite apart from the murder.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

7,“Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,“In what way?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish’s evidence for instance?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“Oh, Lawrence! No, I don’t think so. He’s always a nervous chap.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally by means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as strange— hein?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“No, I can’t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he had started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“Yes, that’s true. I never thought of that.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,“It is odd.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household, he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine poisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been Monsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical knowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence—no! And now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have known was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, mon ami!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“It’s very confusing,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,“That’s another who is not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

7,"“Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more of that ‘private conversation’ than she was willing to admit.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,“And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
7,"“Exactly. One thing her evidence has shown me. I made a mistake. Dorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon, about four o’clock, as she said.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
7,"“Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was he doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have cleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs. Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of that at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance. We must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually, or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your account, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee—Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

8,“Not at all. Why should I?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“I can’t help feeling,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“that we’ve rather left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her having been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen miles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively that she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“Yes, my friend,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

8,“Well?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday, and that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That disposes of that.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,“Oh!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“Really,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“it’s her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her. I can’t help feeling she’d do anything against him.

She is so terribly bitter against him.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,“You consider her vehemence unnatural?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings

8,"“No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or degenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of well-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was—a very ridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that, in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don’t at all see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and ridiculous to the last degree.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction, that they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss Howard’s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“Why, she was devoted to her!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,“Tcha! Tcha!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“You argue like a child. If Miss Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against Alfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions, which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“Now, to my way of thinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard’s being the murderess.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,“And that is?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,“That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp’s death benefit Miss Howard. Now there is no murder without a motive.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,“Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,“But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the same position, so I used her name instead.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the afternoon of her death may——”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
8,"“No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will. But I can tell you this much—it was not in Miss Howard’s favour.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“Well,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot

The fact is, we’ve treated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I don’t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there’s a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when one doesn’t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole thing’s damned awkward! And I’m thankful he’s had the tact to take himself off. It’s a good thing Styles wasn’t the mater’s to leave to him. Couldn’t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He’s welcome to her money.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings

8,"“I will tell him, Dorcas,”",Arthur Hastings,Dorcas
8,"“Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite a different class from them two detectives from London, what goes prying about, and asking questions.

8,“Ohó!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,“Ohó!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“New,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“Yes, quite new.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
8,"“We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to you for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are they often used, may I ask?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
8,"“Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call ‘a dress-up night.’ And very funny it is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he’s wonderful. Most comic! I shall never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he called it—a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in his hand, and ‘Mind, Dorcas,’ he says, ‘you’ll have to be very respectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it’s off with your head if I’m at all displeased with you!’ Miss Cynthia, she was what they call an Apache, or some such name—a Frenchified sort of cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You’d never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
8,"“These evenings must have been great fun,”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
8,"“I suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he was Shah of Persia?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
8,"“He did have a beard, sir,”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
8,"“And well I know it, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And I’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn’t know as there was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately, I think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of hair. Burnt corks they use mostly—though ‘tis messy getting it off again. Miss Cynthia was a character once, and, oh, the trouble she had.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot

8,"“That is arsenic—not strychnine,”",Hercule Poirot,Evelyn Howard

9,"“He said twice: ‘That alters everything.’ And I’ve been thinking. You know Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it was just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn’t it possible that, as Inglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something into the coffee in passing?”",Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
9,"“H’m,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
9,“It would have been very risky.”,John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings

If Bauerstein’s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be tested. And of course they would find no strychnine!

9,"“He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,”",Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish

9,"“H’m, yes, that might be,”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings

9,“Something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true.”,John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
9,“What’s that?”,Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
9,"“Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn’t have done so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at heart disease.”",John Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
9,"“Yes,”",Arthur Hastings,John Cavendish
9,"“But we don’t know. Perhaps he thought it safer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation.

10,"“Yes—that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Ah!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless——”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Mademoiselle Dorcas, Mademoiselle Dorcas, un moment, s’il vous plaît!”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
10,"“My good Dorcas, I have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove justified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday, Dorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong with Mrs. Inglethorp’s bell?”",Hercule Poirot,Dorcas
10,"“Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don’t know how you came to hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire through. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.”",Dorcas,Hercule Poirot
10,"“See you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should be enough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on the right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I leap!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“What is your remarkable little friend doing?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“What is it all about?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Really, I can’t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell, and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as you see!”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“How ridiculous! He’s going out of the gate. Isn’t he coming back to-day?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“I don’t know. I’ve given up trying to guess what he’ll do next.”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,"“Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“I honestly don’t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method in his madness.”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“I see.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in this case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Mr. Hastings,”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“do you think I and my husband are happy together?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Well,”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“whether it is your business or not, I will tell you that we are not happy.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“You don’t know anything about me, do you?”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Where I come from, who I was before I married John—anything, in fact? Well, I will tell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I think—yes, I am sure you are kind.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“My father was English,”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“but my mother was a Russian.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Ah,”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“now I understand——”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“Understand what?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“A hint of something foreign—different—that there has always been about you.”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,"“My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don’t know, because I never saw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was some tragedy connected with her death—she took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was broken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service. Everywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had been nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life—I loved it.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live with some old aunts in Yorkshire.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“You will understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“And then I met John Cavendish.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“Yes?”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,"“You can imagine that, from my aunts’ point of view, it was a very good match for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Don’t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what was true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with him. He declared that that satisfied him, and so—we were married.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“I think—I am sure—he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not well matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He—it is not a pleasing thing for my pride, but it is the truth—tired of me very soon.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Oh, yes, he did! Not that it matters now—now that we’ve come to the parting of the ways.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“What do you mean?”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“You and John are not going to live here?”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,"“John may live here, but I shall not.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“You are going to leave him?”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“Yes.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“But why?”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“Perhaps—because I want to be—free!”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“You don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison to me!”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“I understand,”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“but—but don’t do anything rash.”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,"“Oh, rash!”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Well, what do you think?”",Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“Of what?”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“Of the arrest?”,Arthur Hastings,Mary Cavendish
10,“What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener had told John.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,"“These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind moving—thank you, Mr. Hastings.”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“Gone to London again?”,Arthur Hastings,Poirot's Landlady
10,"“Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. ‘To see a young lady’s dispensary,’ he said.”",Poirot's Landlady,Arthur Hastings
10,“Silly ass!”,Arthur Hastings,Poirot's Landlady
10,"“I told him Wednesday was the one day she wasn’t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will you?”",Arthur Hastings,Poirot's Landlady
10,"“Certainly, monsieur.”",Poirot's Landlady,Arthur Hastings
10,"“No, I don’t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.”",Arthur Hastings,Lawrence Cavendish
10,“Oh!”,Lawrence Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“What is it?”,Arthur Hastings,Lawrence Cavendish
10,“I could go if there’s anything special.”,Arthur Hastings,Lawrence Cavendish
10,"“It’s nothing much, but—well, if you are going, will you tell him——”",Lawrence Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“I think I’ve found the extra coffee-cup!”,Lawrence Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“What is it?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“You are not ill, I trust?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Whether to catch the criminal or not?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“‘To speak or not to speak,’ as your so great Shakespeare says, ‘that is the question.’”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“You are not serious, Poirot?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“And that is?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“A woman’s happiness, mon ami,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“The moment has come,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“and I do not know what to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one but I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Aha!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good. He has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur Lawrence of yours!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady was most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me everything in the kindest way.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Oh, well, that’s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia another day.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“I am sorry for that,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“I always had hopes of that letter. But no, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“These little grey cells. It is ‘up to them’—as you say over here.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Are you a judge of finger-marks, my friend?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“No,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“I know that there are no two finger-marks alike, but that’s as far as my science goes.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“Exactly.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man’s finger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady’s; they are much smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here, very distinctly, are No. 1’s.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“Overlapping the others?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Yes.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“You recognize them beyond fail?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Oh, yes; they are identical.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“I suppose,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“that as usual, you are not going to explain?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence. No. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I merely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more complicated.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Yes?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of blur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the special apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a well-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a photograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of time. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks—it remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Go on—I am really excited.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“Eh bien! Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster—which sounds like the house that Jack built!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Good heavens!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“But what were Lawrence Cavendish’s finger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“Oh, yes, he did!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Impossible! We were all together the whole time.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together. There was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it would not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and join you on the balcony.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“I’d forgotten that,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“But it was only for a moment.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“Long enough.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Long enough for what?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Poirot,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“what was in this particular little bottle?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“Hydro-chloride of strychnine,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Good heavens!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—only occasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine Hydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“How did you manage to take this photograph?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“I dropped my hat from the balcony,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Visitors were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia’s colleague had to go down and fetch it for me.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“Then you knew what you were going to find?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your story, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The possibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“Poirot,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,“your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very important discovery.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“I do not know,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“But one thing does strike me. No doubt it has struck you too.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,“What is that?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
10,"“Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case. This is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in Mrs. Inglethorp’s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the counter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine, handled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I do not like confusion.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
10,"“There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.”",Belgian Roommate,Hercule Poirot
10,“A lady?”,Arthur Hastings,Belgian Roommate
10,"“I have been visiting an old woman in the village,”",Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings
10,“and as Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would call for you.”,Mary Cavendish,Arthur Hastings

10,“I thought you had come to honour me with a visit!”,Hercule Poirot,Mary Cavendish
10,"“I will some day, if you ask me,”",Mary Cavendish,Hercule Poirot
10,"“That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame”",Hercule Poirot,Mary Cavendish

10,"“Oh, m’am! Oh, m’am! I don’t know how to tell you——”",Dorcas,Mary Cavendish
10,"“What is it, Dorcas?”",Arthur Hastings,Dorcas
10,“Tell us at once.”,Arthur Hastings,Dorcas
10,“It’s those wicked detectives. They’ve arrested him—they’ve arrested Mr. Cavendish!”,Dorcas,Arthur Hastings
10,“Arrested Lawrence?”,Arthur Hastings,Dorcas
10,"“No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence—Mr. John.”",Dorcas,Arthur Hastings
11,"“Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her jealousy have——”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“Jealousy?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As I was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks of nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over him.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“Even now,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very last minute, I thought it was Lawrence!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,“I know you did.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“But John! My old friend John!”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Every murderer is probably somebody’s old friend,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“I must say I think you might have given me a hint.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Perhaps, mon ami, I did not do so, just because he was your old friend.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“But, Poirot——”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs. It is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another matter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little evidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I lack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing link——”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“When did you first suspect John Cavendish?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,“Did you not suspect him at all?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“No, indeed.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“No.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife—and you remember, he strenuously denied it at the inquest—it must be either Lawrence or John. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish’s conduct was just as inexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing was explained quite naturally.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“So,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,“it was John who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,“Exactly.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“And you have known this all along?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,“Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish’s behaviour could only be explained that way.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“And yet you say he may be acquitted?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the case for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the trial. And—ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my friend. I must not appear in the case.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“What?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish must think I am working for her husband, not against him.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“I say, that’s playing it a bit low down,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man, and we must use any means in our power—otherwise he will slip through our fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the background. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will take all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“it will probably be as a witness for the defence.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“It is quite en règle,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“Strangely enough, I can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,“Which one?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,“The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish did not destroy that will.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
11,"“I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?”",Sir Ernest Heavywether,Dr. Bauerstein
11,“Yes.”,Dr. Bauerstein,Sir Ernest Heavywether
11,“And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?”,Sir Ernest Heavywether,Dr. Bauerstein

11,"“In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what would be done with it?”",Mr. Philips,Dorcas
11,“It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.”,Dorcas,Mr. Philips

11,"“No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard who would attend to anything like that.”",Dorcas,Mr. Philips

11,"“Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?”",Mr. Philips,Evelyn Howard

11,“On the top of—of—a wardrobe.”,Evelyn Howard,Mr. Philips
11,“On top of the prisoner’s wardrobe?”,Mr. Philips,Evelyn Howard
11,“I—I believe so.”,Evelyn Howard,Mr. Philips
11,“Did you not find it yourself?”,Mr. Philips,Evelyn Howard

11,“Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
11,"“I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are divided in their opinion as to which brother did it.

11,"“Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself searched the prisoner’s room, during his temporary absence from the house.

11,“He might have stowed them there in a hurry.”,Inspector Japp,Sir Ernest Heavywether

13,"“Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp’s death, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away from that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no idea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of Mr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it. When I arrived at the château, I realized at once that it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the way, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Yes, yes,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“Go on.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp’s guilt were very much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that I was inclined to believe that he had not done it.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“When did you change your mind?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more efforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that Inglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was John Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“But why?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue with Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I discovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who was attracted by the farmer’s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a different interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This attitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. Eh bien! from that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be arrested.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“Wait a minute. I don’t see why he wished to be arrested?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Because, mon ami, it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it was clever—his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his irreproachable alibi—and, hey presto, he was safe for life!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“But I still don’t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to the chemist’s shop?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was Miss Howard who went to the chemist’s shop?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“Miss Howard?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and Inglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between them, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself. They are a clever pair!”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Bon! I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember her once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she dispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she occasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp’s large sized bottle of medicine when it came from Coot’s? The risk is practically nil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have forgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her quarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her absence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too clever—and that was their undoing.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying strychnine at the village chemist’s, and signing the register in his hand-writing.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On Monday, therefore, at six o’clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs. Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six o’clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the chemist’s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John’s handwriting, which she had previously studied carefully.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes him an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing—which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred Inglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him in any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which, after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John Cavendish.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine that night. The broken bell, Cynthia’s absence—arranged by Inglethorp through his wife—all these are wasted. And then—he makes his slip.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice, who, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected. Caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it again, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little dreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the incriminating document.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though, unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her mind. She knows that she is in danger—but is ignorant of where the danger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down and writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made. She keeps the fatal letter.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock of the despatch-case?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely nothing to connect him with the crime.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“There’s only one thing I can’t make out, why didn’t he destroy it at once when he got hold of it?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of keeping it on his own person.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“I don’t understand.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before that time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters the room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys—they were all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case—it is locked, and the keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had hoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a penknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking for.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper on him. He may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched. If the paper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute, too, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the boudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of paper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case, are sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he dare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees—what do you think, mon ami?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle-piece.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“No one would think of looking there,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“And he will be able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom, under our very noses?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my ‘last link,’ and I owe that very fortunate discovery to you.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“To me?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Yes, but I don’t see——”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in the morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all the objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened, there would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the meantime, someone else had touched them.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Dear me,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still there?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Yes, and it was a race for time.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“But I still can’t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Ah, but he had no opportunity. I saw to that.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“You?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my confidence on the subject?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“Yes.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then if Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he would not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere, and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by making the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur detectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving it in the spill vase.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper’s existence. In accordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred Inglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John Cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a meeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too clever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely they would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never have been able to bring him to justice.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss Howard?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Why, what was there to lie about?”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“Yes—more or less.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that ‘July 17th’ is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I mean?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“No,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“I don’t.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on the 7th—the day after Miss Howard’s departure? The ‘1’ was written in before the ‘7’ to turn it into the ‘17th’.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“But why?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the letter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at once a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“And yet,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“after that, you gave me two reasons why Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“And very good reasons too,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“For a long time they were a stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact: that she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not debar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather over-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion. There was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he came to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot—that he should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make a will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would probably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim’s money.",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to be directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a very different dénouement. She arrives from Middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No notice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the strychnine and glasses in John’s room. She puts the beard in the attic. She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“I don’t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to Lawrence.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot

13,“La pauvre petite! And she was concerned?”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“She said that she did not mind at all.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Then she certainly did mind very much,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“They are like that—les femmes!”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia was in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother’s room, and saw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that Mademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly driven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his feet, remembering that she had gone up with his mother the night before, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld the theory of ‘Death from natural causes’.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“And what about the ‘extra coffee-cup’?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but I had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant; but, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion. And he was perfectly right.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Dear me, Poirot,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“I think you have explained everything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his wife are reconciled.”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,“Thanks to me.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“How do you mean—thanks to you?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still loved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love with him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a misunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a sensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she did not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are both unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He drifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately cultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of John Cavendish’s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big decision?”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Yes, I quite understood your distress.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Pardon me, mon ami, but you did not understand it in the least. I was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at once. I could have cleared him—though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment—which partly accounts for my success.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being brought to trial?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of ‘a woman’s happiness’. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again.”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“I perceive your thoughts, mon ami,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,“No one but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are wrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the greatest thing in all the world.”,Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
13,"“Yes, madame,”",Hercule Poirot,Mary Cavendish
13,“I have brought him back to you.”,Hercule Poirot,Mary Cavendish
13,"“Perhaps you are right, Poirot,”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“Yes, it is the greatest thing in the world.”",Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot

13,“You dears!”,Cynthia Murdoch,Hercule Poirot
13,“What on earth does this mean?”,Arthur Hastings,Hercule Poirot
13,"“It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike her as much as she thought,”",Hercule Poirot,Arthur Hastings
