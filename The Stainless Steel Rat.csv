1,James Bolivar diGriz I arrest you on the charge—,Cop George,James diGriz
1,"... On the charge of illegal entry, theft, forgery—",Cop George,James diGriz
1,In addition the charge of assaulting a police robot will be added to your record. This was foolish since my brain and larynx are armored and in my midsection—,Cop George,James diGriz
1,"That I know well, George, but your little two-way radio is in the top of your pointed head and I don't want you reporting to your friends just yet.",James diGriz,Cop George
2,"Over there. The M-19 that was loading these burned out a brakeband, you better see that they're taken care of.",James diGriz,Shipping Department Robot
3,"Have one of these, diGriz, I believe they're your brand.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,"Sit down diGriz and put that cannon away. If I wanted to kill you, I could have done it a lot easier than herding you into this room.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,Don't tell me you thought it was an accident that you ended up here?,Inskipp,James diGriz
3,"Had me worried there for a minute, the way you stood there rolling your eyes and waving this piece of field artillery around.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,Who are you?,James diGriz,Inskipp
3,"Well, it doesn't matter who I am. What does matter is the organization that I represent.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,The Corps?,James diGriz,Inskipp
3,"Exactly. The Special Corps. You didn't think I was the local police, did you? They have orders to shoot you on sight. It was only after I told them how to find you that they let the Corps come along on the job. I have some of my men in the building, they're the ones who herded you up here. The rest are all locals with itchy trigger fingers.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,"All right Mr. Detective, you have me so there is no sense in gloating. What's next on the program? Psychological reorientation, lobotomy—or just plain firing squad?",James diGriz,Inskipp
3,"None of those, I'm afraid. I am here to offer you a job on the Corps.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,"I will admit it has its ludicrous side—but only at first glance. If you stop to think, you will have to admit that who is better qualified to catch a thief than another thief?",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,"An interesting offer, but I'm not getting out of this by playing the rat. There is even a code among thieves, you know.",James diGriz,Inskipp
3,"What kind of stupidity do you call that? It sounds like a line out of a TV thriller. You've never met another crook in your whole life and you know it! And if you did you would cheerfully turn him in if you could make a profit on the deal. The entire essence of your life is individualism—that and the excitement of doing what others can't do. Well that's over now, and you better start admitting it to yourself. You can no longer be the interplanet playboy you used to be—but you can do a job that will require every bit of your special talents and abilities. Have you ever killed a man?",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,No ... not that I know of.,James diGriz,Inskipp
3,"Well you haven't, if that will make you sleep any better at night. You're not a homicidal, I checked that on your record before I came out after you. That is why I know you will join the Corps and get a great deal of pleasure out of going after the other kind of criminal who is sick, not just socially protesting. The man who can kill and enjoy it.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,"What about the Corps, if they ever find out you are hiring half-reformed criminals to do your dirty work we will both be shot at dawn.",James diGriz,Inskipp
3,"In the first place my boy, I am the Corps—at least the man at the top—and what do you think my name is? Harold Peters Inskipp, that's what it is!",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,Not the Inskipp that—,James diGriz,Inskipp
3,The same. Inskipp the Uncatchable. The man who looted the Pharsydion II in mid-flight and pulled all those other deals I'm sure you read about in your misspent youth. I was recruited just the way you were.,Inskipp,James diGriz
3,"And who do you think the rest of our agents are? I don't mean the bright-eyed grads of our technical schools, like the ones on my squad downstairs. I mean the full agents. The men who plan the operations, do the preliminary fieldwork and see that everything comes off smoothly. They're crooks. All crooks. The better they were on their own, the better a job they do for the Corps. It's a great, big, brawling universe and you would be surprised at some of the problems that come up. The only men we can recruit to do the job are the ones who have already succeeded at it.",Inskipp,James diGriz
3,Are you on?,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"You should have more brains than that, diGriz,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,Creeping into my room at night! You could have been shot.,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"No I couldn't,",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,A man with a curiosity bump as big as yours will always talk first and shoot later. And besides—none of this pussyfooting around in the dark would be necessary if your screen was open and I could have got a call through.,James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Just because I head the Special Corps, doesn't mean that I am the Special Corps,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"I have to sleep sometime. My screen is open only for emergency calls, not for every agent who needs his hand held.",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,Meaning I am in the hand-holding category?,James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Put yourself in any category you damn well please,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,And also put yourself out into the hall and see me tomorrow during working hours.,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,Do you know what this is?,James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Big warship of some kind, looks like Empire lines. Now for the last time—go away!",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"A very good guess for this late at night,",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,It is a late Empire battleship of the Warlord class. Undoubtedly one of the most truly efficient engines of destruction ever manufactured. Over a half mile of defensive screens and armament that could probably turn any fleet existent today into fine radioactive ash—,James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Except for the fact that the last one was broken up for scrap over a thousand years ago,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"True, true,",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,But wouldn't you be just a little bit interested if I was to tell you that one is being built today?,James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Talk, blast you diGriz—talk!",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,What is this nonsense about a battleship? Who's building it?,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"Put diGriz in charge of the record room for a while, you said, that way he can learn the ropes. Burrowing around in century-old, dusty files will be just the thing for a free spirit like Slippery Jim diGriz. Teach him discipline. Show him what the Corps stands for. At the same time it will get the records in shape. They have been needing reorganization for quite a while.",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"So you thought you had me safely out of the way. Breaking my spirit under the guise of 'giving me a little background in the Corps' activities.' In this sense your plan failed. Something else happened instead. I nosed through the files and found them most interesting. Particularly the C & M setup—the Categorizer and Memory. That building full of machinery that takes in and digests news and reports from all the planets in the galaxy, indexes it to every category it can possibly relate, then files it. Great machine to work with. I had it digging out spaceship info for me, something I have always been interested in—",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"You should be,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,You've stolen enough of them in your time.,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"I won't bore you with all the details, since you seem impatient, but eventually I turned up this plan.",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,What are you getting at?,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,This is an ordinary heavy-cargo and passenger job. It's no more a Warlord battleship than I am.,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"Of course. You don't expect them to file warship plans with the League Registry, do you? But, as I said, I know more than a little bit about ships. It seemed to me this thing was just too big for the use intended. Enough old ships are fuel-wasters, you don't have to build new ones to do that. This started me thinking and I punched for a complete list of ships that size that had been constructed in the past. You can imagine my surprise when, after three minutes of groaning, the C & M only produced six. One was built for self-sustaining colony attempt at the second galaxy. For all we know she is still on the way. The other five were all D-class colonizers, built during the Expansion when large populations were moved. Too big to be practical now.",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"I was still teased, as I had no idea what a ship this large could be used for. So I removed the time interlock on the C & M and let it pick around through the entire history of space to see if it could find a comparison. It sure did. Right at the Golden Age of Empire expansion, the giant Warlord battleship. The machine even found a blueprint for me.",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Notice—if the engine room specs are changed slightly to include this cargo hold, there is plenty of room for the brutes needed. This superstructure—obviously just tacked onto the plans—gets thrown away, and turrets take its place. The hulls are identical. A change here, a shift there, and the stodgy freighter becomes the fast battle-wagon. These changes could be made during construction, then plans filed. By the time anyone in the League found out what was being built the ship would be finished and launched. Of course, this could all be coincidence—the plans of a newly built ship agreeing to six places with those of a ship built a thousand years ago. But if you think so, I will give you hundred-to-one odds you are wrong, any size bet you name.",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,And the name of the peace-loving planet that is building this bad-memory from the past?,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,Cittanuvo. Second planet of a B star in Corona Borealis. No other colonized planets in the system.,James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Never heard of it,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,Which may be a good or a bad sign. Wouldn't be the first time trouble came from some out-of-the-way spot I never even knew existed.,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"The more I look at this thing,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"the fishier it gets. This planet seems to have no possible motive or use for a battleship. But they are building one—that I will swear on a stack of one thousand credit notes as high as this building. Yet what will they do with it when they have it built? They have an expanding culture, no unemployment, a surplus of heavy metals and ready markets for all they produce. No hereditary enemies, feuds or the like. If it wasn't for this battleship thing, I would call them an ideal League planet. I have to know more about them.",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"I've already called the spaceport—in your name of course,",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,Ordered a fast courier ship. I'll leave within the hour.,James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself, diGriz,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,I still give the orders and I'll tell you when you're ready for an independent command.,Inskipp,James diGriz
4,"Just trying to help, chief, get things ready in case you wanted more info. And this isn't really an operation, just a reconnaissance. I can do that as well as any of the experienced operators. And it may give me the experience I need, so that some day, I, too, will be qualified to join the ranks....",James diGriz,Inskipp
4,"All right,",Inskipp,James diGriz
4,Stop shoveling it on while I can still breathe. Get out there. Find out what is happening. Then get back. Nothing else—and that's an order.,Inskipp,James diGriz
5,"Beautiful planet you have here. Delightful climate! Ideal spot for a country home. Friendly people, always willing to help strangers and all that I imagine. That's what I like. Makes me feel grateful. Very pleased to meet you. I am the Grand Duke Sant' Angelo.",James diGriz,Customs Official
5,"Now,",James diGriz,Customs Official
5,"I wonder if you would ask the customs agents to look at my bags here. Don't want to waste time, do we? The ship is open, they can check that whenever they please.",James diGriz,Customs Official
5,All rooms checked. Results negative except for one optic bug in that wall.,Corps Robot,James diGriz
5,Should you be pointing like that?,James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,"Might make people suspicious, you know.",James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,"Impossible,",Corps Robot,James diGriz
5,I brushed against it and it is now unserviceable.,Corps Robot,James diGriz
5,"You there, short and chunky,",James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,"Do you have any concealed compartments or drawers built into your steel hide? If so, let's see.",James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,"Come over here and sit down, quick!",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"I am Admiral Thar, League Grand Fleet. These are my credentials. You had better check them.",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,What do you mean by entering my private quarters and burglaring—,President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,"You're in very bad trouble,",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"I am arresting you for conspiracy, extortion, theft, and whatever other charges develop after a careful review of these documents. Seize him.",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"I am arresting you for conspiracy, extortion, theft, and whatever other charges develop after a careful review of these documents. Seize him.",James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,"I can explain,",President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,"Everything can be explained. There is no need to make such charges. I don't know what papers you have there, so I wouldn't attempt to say they are all forgeries. I have many enemies you know. If the League knew the difficulties faced on a backward planet like this....",President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,"That will be entirely enough,",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,All those questions will be answered by a court at the proper time. There is only one question I want an answer to now. Why are you building that battleship?,James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,What battleship?,President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,The Warlord class battleship that is being built at the Cenerentola Spaceyards. Disguised behind these blueprints.,James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"Those are your initials there, authorizing construction.",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"I know nothing about any battleship. These are the plans for a new cargo liner. Those are my initials, I recall putting them there.",President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,You deny any knowledge of the Warlord battleship that is being built from these modified plans.,James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"These are the plans for an ordinary passenger-freighter, that is all I know.",President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,"Wouldn't you be interested in knowing something about that robot who is holding you,",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"That is no ordinary robot. It has a number of interesting devices built into its fingertips. Thermocouples, galvanometers, things like that. While you talked it registered your skin temperature, blood pressure, amount of perspiration and such. In other words it is an efficient and fast working lie detector. We will now hear all about your lies.",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"Report,",James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,Has this man told any lies?,James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,"Many,",Corps Robot,James diGriz
5,Exactly seventy-four per cent of all statements he made were false.,Corps Robot,James diGriz
5,"Very good,",James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,That means he knows all about this battleship.,James diGriz,Corps Robot
5,"The subject has no knowledge of the battleship,",Corps Robot,James diGriz
5,All of his statements concerning the construction of this ship were true.,Corps Robot,James diGriz
5,Rocca!,James diGriz,Rocca
5,"Look at these plans, at this space-going front porch here. Is it still being built onto the ship?",James diGriz,Rocca
5,"No, the plans were changed. We had to fit in some kind of new meteor-repelling gear for operating in the planetary debris belt.",Rocca,James diGriz
5,Does your new gear look anything like this?,James diGriz,Rocca
5,"Well,",Rocca,James diGriz
5,"I don't want to say for certain. After all, these details aren't in my department, I'm just responsible for final assembly, not unit work. But this surely looks like the thing they installed. Big thing. Lots of power leads—",Rocca,James diGriz
5,Installed!,James diGriz,Rocca
5,Did you say installed?,James diGriz,Rocca
5,Yes—,Rocca,James diGriz
5,not too long ago. I remember there was some trouble....,Rocca,James diGriz
5,And what else?,James diGriz,Rocca
5,"The drives, controls—are they in, too?",James diGriz,Rocca
5,"Why, yes,",Rocca,James diGriz
5,"How did you know? The normal scheduling was changed around, causing a great deal of unnecessary trouble.",Rocca,James diGriz
5,Cars! Guns!,James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"To the spaceyard. If that ship is anywhere near completion, we are in big, big trouble!",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,Cars! Guns!,James diGriz,Rocca
5,"To the spaceyard. If that ship is anywhere near completion, we are in big, big trouble!",James diGriz,Rocca
5,Rocca!,James diGriz,Rocca
5,Get into the car. I want to see your records—all of your records—and I want to see them right now.,James diGriz,Rocca
5,But admiral ... the hour! Everyone will be asleep....,Rocca,James diGriz
5,"You've found them, the criminal ring?",President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,"I have found them, yes,",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,"But not a criminal ring. An inspired master criminal—who apparently has more executive ability in one ear lobe than all your bribe-bloated bureaucrats—and his female assistant. They pulled the entire job by themselves. His name, or undoubtedly pseudoname, is Pepe Nero. The girl is called Angelina....",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,Arrest them at once! Guards ... guards—,President Ferraro,James diGriz
5,"That is just what we intend to do, but it's a little difficult at the moment since they are the ones who not only built the battleship, but undoubtedly stole it as well. It was fully automated so no crew is necessary.",James diGriz,President Ferraro
5,What do you plan to do?,Clerk,James diGriz
5,"I shall do nothing,",James diGriz,Clerk
5,The League fleet is already closing in on the renegades and you will be informed of the capture. Thank you for your assistance.,James diGriz,Clerk
6,"League Central 14—rush,",James diGriz,Psiman
6,"... xybb dfil fdno, and if you don't—don't come back!",Psiman,James diGriz
6,"Great, great—but why a battleship?",James diGriz,
6,"Get the Communications Officer in here at once,",James diGriz,
6,Also a couple of clerks with transcribers. And fast—this is a matter of life or death!,James diGriz,
6,What in the devil does this nonsense mean?,Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"Billionaire to found own world ... space yacht filled with luxuries to last a hundred years,",Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,What connection does this tripe have with catching those murderers?,Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"This tripe and nonsense,",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,is the bait that will snag our fish. A trap for Pepe and his partner in crime.,James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,Who is this mysterious billionaire?,Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"Me,",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,I've always wanted to be rich.,James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,"But this ship, the space yacht, where is it?",Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"Being built now in the naval shipyard at Udrydde. We're almost ready to go there now, soon as this batch of instructions goes out.",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,"It doesn't make sense,",Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,How can you be sure this killer will ever read one of these things. And if he does—why should he be interested? It looks to me as if you are wasting time while he slips through your fingers. The alarm should be out and every ship notified. The Navy alerted and patrols set on all spacelanes—,Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"Which he could easily avoid by going around, or better yet not even bother about, since he can lick any ship we have. That's not the answer,",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,This Pepe is smart and as tricky as a fixed gambling machine. That's his strength—and his weakness as well. Characters like that never think it possible for someone else to outthink them. Which is what I'm going to do.,James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,"Modest, aren't you,",Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"I try not to be,",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,"False modesty is the refuge of the incompetent. I'm going to catch this thug and I'll tell you how I'll do it. He's going to hit again soon, and wherever he hits there will be some kind of a periodical with my plant in it. Whatever else he is after, he is going to take all of the magazines and papers he can find. Partly to satisfy his own ego, but mostly to keep track of the things he is interested in. Such as ship sailings.",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,You're just guessing—you don't know all this.,Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"Yes, I'm guessing—an informed guess—but I do know some facts as well. Ogget's Dream was cleaned out of all reading matter, that was one of the first things I checked. We can't stop the battleship from attacking again, but we can see to it that the time after that she sails into a trap.",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,"I don't know,",Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,it sounds to me like....,Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"They hit again, knocked out a Navy supply satellite, thirty-four men dead.",Psiman,James diGriz
6,"If your plan doesn't work, admiral,",Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,I'll personally see that you're flayed alive!,Captain Steng,James diGriz
6,"If my plan doesn't work, captain—there won't be enough of my skin left to pick up with a tweezer. Now if you please, I'd like to get to Udrydde and board my ship as soon as possible.",James diGriz,Captain Steng
6,"Belay that last command,",James diGriz,Psiman
6,Get a call through first and find out if any of our plants were picked up during the raid.,James diGriz,Psiman
6,"Affirmative,",Psiman,James diGriz
6,"A store ship docked there twenty hours before the attack. Among other things, it left newspapers containing the article.",Psiman,James diGriz
6,"Very good,",James diGriz,Psiman
6,"Send a general order to suspend all future activity with the planted releases. Send it by psimen only, no mention on any other Naval signaling equipment, there's a good chance now it might be 'overheard.'",James diGriz,Psiman
6,"Hold on there, sailor,",James diGriz,
6,Nothing has changed. It's still the best and only plan possible under the circumstances.,James diGriz,
7,"... That you are under the guns of a warship! Don't attempt to run, signal, take evasive action, or in any other way....",Pepe,James diGriz
7,Who are you—and what the devil do you want?,James diGriz,Pepe
7,"It doesn't matter who we are,",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"Just obey orders if you care to live. Stay away from the controls until we have tied on, then do exactly as I say.",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"Now let me tell you something,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,First I'll repeat your own warning—obey orders if you want to live. I'll show you why—,James diGriz,Pepe
7,"That's the ship's generators you're looking at,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,Ninety-eight per cent of their output is now feeding into coils that make an electromagnet of this ship's hull. You will find it very hard to separate us. And I would advise you not to try.,James diGriz,Pepe
7,"You are now looking at a hydrogen bomb that is primed and aware of the magnetic field holding our ships together. It will, of course, go off if you try to pull away.",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"This is a different bomb now,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"This one has receptors on the hull. If you attempt to destroy any part of this ship, or even gain entry to it, this one will detonate.",James diGriz,Pepe
7,What do you want?,Pepe,James diGriz
7,"I want to talk to you, arrange a deal. Something that would be profitable for both of us. But let me first show you the rest of the bombs, so you won't get any strange ideas about co-operating.",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"Yeah, yeah ... I take your word for it, you're a flying bomb. So stop with this roving reporter bit and tell me what you have in mind.",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"The game's over,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"The game's over,",James diGriz,Angelina
7,Stand up slowly and keep your hands in sight.,James diGriz,Pepe
7,Stand up slowly and keep your hands in sight.,James diGriz,Angelina
7,"What do you mean,",Pepe,James diGriz
7,He's here!,Angelina,Pepe
7,"You're under arrest, crime-king,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,And your girl friend.,James diGriz,Pepe
7,What ... what will happen now?,Pepe,James diGriz
7,Will they do anything to me?,Angelina,James diGriz
7,I have no idea of what will happen to you.,James diGriz,Angelina
7,That is up to the courts to decide.,James diGriz,Angelina
7,"But he made me do all those things,",Angelina,James diGriz
7,"Sit up, Pepe. I find it very hard to believe that you are crying. There are some Naval ships on the way now, the automatic alarm was triggered about a minute ago. I'm sure they'll be glad to see the man who....",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"Don't let them take me, please!",Angelina,James diGriz
7,"They'll put me in prison, do things to my mind!",Angelina,James diGriz
7,"There's nothing I can do,",James diGriz,Angelina
7,"Don't try to run,",James diGriz,Angelina
7,it can't do any good!,James diGriz,Angelina
7,"So she caught you, too, Mr. Wise-cop, poor little Angelina with the soft eyes.",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"What do you mean,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"Don't you catch yet? The story she told you was true—except she twisted it around a bit. The whole plan, building the battleship, then stealing it, was hers. She pulled me into it, played me like an accordion. I fell in love with her, hating myself and happy at the same time. Well—I'm glad now it's over. At least I gave her a chance to get away, I owe her that much. Though I thought I would explode when she went into that innocence act!",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"You're lying,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,Sorry. That's the way it is. Your brain-boys will pick my skull to pieces and find out the truth anyway. There's no point in lying now.,Pepe,James diGriz
7,"We'll search the ship, she can't hide for long.",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"She won't have to,",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"There's a fast scout we picked up, stowed in one of the holds. That must be it leaving now.",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"The Navy will get her,",James diGriz,Pepe
7,"Maybe,",Pepe,James diGriz
7,"Maybe they will. But I gave her her chance. It is all over for me now, but she knows that I loved her to the end.",Pepe,James diGriz
7,Not that she will care in the slightest.,Pepe,James diGriz
8,"You can't win them all,",James diGriz,Inskipp
8,"I brought home your battleship and Pepe—may his personality rest in peace now that it has been erased. Angelina tricked me and got away, I'll admit that. But she did a much better job of fooling the boys in the navy!",James diGriz,Inskipp
8,Why so much venom?,Inskipp,James diGriz
8,No one's accusing you of dereliction of duty. You sound like a man with a guilty conscience. You did a good job. A fine job. A great job ... for a first assignment....,Inskipp,James diGriz
8,You're doing it again!,James diGriz,Inskipp

17,"Don't you realize this girl doesn't exist except in your own memory,",James diGriz,Angelina
17,It's past like everything else. You were a baby—now you're a woman. You were a little girl—now you're a woman. You may have been this girl—but you are not any more!,James diGriz,Angelina
17,"You're none of those things of the past, Angelina!",James diGriz,Angelina
17,You are yourself ... just yourself!,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"Here's the killer,",James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,"Stay here, Bent,",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,Well look at that!,James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,You know what this is?,The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"Of course,",James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,But not from seeing them on Freibur. They aren't that common.,James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,"They aren't common at all,",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"As far as I know this is the only one on the planet—so I wish you wouldn't mention it to anybody. Anybody,",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"Not my business,",James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,I think a man's entitled to his privacy.,James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,"You're not a stupid man, Grav Diebstall,",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"You've been offplanet and seen other worlds. You know how backward and suppressed we are here, or you wouldn't have joined with me to help throw off the yoke around our planet's neck. No sacrifice is too great if it will bring closer this day of liberation.",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,This foreign woman you have been guarding—,The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"She had been of some help in organizing things, but is now putting us in an embarrassing position. There has been one attempt on her life and there will probably be others. The Radebrechen are an old and loyal family—her presence is a continued insult to them.",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"I think that you can do the job she is doing. Just as well, and perhaps better. How would you like that?",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"I am honored, noble Count,",James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,But what will happen to the foreign woman? I don't imagine she will think much of the idea.,James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,"What she thinks is not important,",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"We cannot be cruel to her,",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"We'll just hold her in custody. She has some guards who I imagine will be loyal, but my men will take care of them. You will be with her and arrest her at the proper time. Just turn her over to the jailers who will keep her safe. Safe for herself, and out of sight where she can cause no more trouble for us.",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"It's a good plan,",James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,"I don't enjoy the thought of putting this poor woman in jail, but if it is necessary to the cause it must be done. The ends justify the means.",James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,"You're right. I only wish I was able to state it so clearly. You have a remarkable ability to turn a phrase, Bent. I'm going to write that down so I can remember it. The ends justify....",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,"If we are going to do this we should not waste any time, Count Rdenrundt,",James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,I suggest 1800 hours tonight for the action. That will give you enough time to arrange for the capture of her guards. I will be in her rooms and will arrest her as soon as I have a message from you that the first move has succeeded.,James diGriz,The Count of Rdenrundt
18,"You're correct. A man of action as always, Bent. It will be as you say.",The Count of Rdenrundt,James diGriz
18,Can we be overheard here?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"No, the room is completely shielded.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"Your former boy-friend, Count Cassi, has a snooper-detector. He may have other equipment for listening to what goes on here.",James diGriz,Angelina
18,"I know about the detector,",Angelina,James diGriz
18,I arranged for him to get it—without his knowledge of course—and made sure it was useless on the best frequencies. I keep a close watch on his affairs that way.,Angelina,James diGriz
18,Were you listening in a few minutes ago when he was making arrangements with me to kill your guards and throw you into the dungeons downstairs?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"No, I wasn't listening,",Angelina,James diGriz
18,I was busy just remembering last night.,Angelina,James diGriz
18,"Well, if that little bit of news doesn't interest you,",James diGriz,Angelina
18,Perhaps this does. The rough Radebrechens didn't send that killer last night—the Count did.,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"I think you have underestimated the desperation of that rat upstairs. When you dropped him with that bottle yesterday, you pushed him just as far as he could be pushed. He must have had his plans already made and you made his mind up for him. The sergeant of the guard recognized the assassin and connected him with the Count. That also explains how the killer got access to the roof and knew just where to find you. It's also the best explanation I can imagine for the suddenness of this attack. There's too much coincidence here with the thing happening right after your battle with Cassitor the Cantankerous.",James diGriz,Angelina
18,Well—what are you going to do about it?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,Don't you think it's more important to ask what you are going to do about it?,Angelina,James diGriz
18,"You know I'm not Grav Bent Diebstall,",James diGriz,Angelina
18,How long have you known?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"For quite a while; since soon after you came here, in fact.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,Do you know who I am—?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"I have no idea what your real name is, if that's what you mean. But I do remember how angry I was when you tricked me out of the battleships, after all my work. And I recall the intense satisfaction with which I shot you in Freiburbad. Can you tell me your name now?",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"Jim,",James diGriz,Angelina
18,"James diGriz, known as Slippery Jim to the trade.",James diGriz,Angelina
18,"How nice. My name is really Angela. I think it was done as a horrid joke by my father, which is one of the reasons I enjoyed seeing him die.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,Why haven't you killed me?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"Why should I, darling?",Angelina,James diGriz
18,We've both made mistakes in the past and it has taken us a dreadfully long time to find out that we are just alike. I might as well ask you why you haven't arrested me—that's what you started out to do isn't it?,Angelina,James diGriz
18,It was—but....,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"But, what? You must have come here with that idea in mind, but you were fighting an awful battle with yourself. That's why I hid the fact that I knew who you really were. You were growing up, getting over whatever idiotic notions ever involved you with the police in the first place. I had no idea how the whole thing would come out, though I did hope. You see I didn't want to kill you, not unless I had to. I knew you loved me, that was obvious from the beginning. It was different from the feeble animal passion of all those male brutes who have told me that they love me. They loved a malleable case of flesh. You love me for everything that I am, because we are both the same.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"We are not the same,",James diGriz,Angelina
18,You kill—and enjoy killing—that's our basic difference. Don't you see that?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,Nonsense!,Angelina,James diGriz
18,"You killed last night—rather a good job too—and I didn't notice any reluctance on your part. In fact, wasn't there a certain amount of enthusiasm?",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"Let's leave Freibur,",James diGriz,Angelina
18,Get away from this monstrous and unnecessary rebellion. There will be deaths and killing and no need for them.,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"We'll go—if we go someplace where we can do just as well,",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"That's not the major point though. There's something you are going to have to settle in your own mind before you will be happy. This stupid importance you attach to death. Don't you realize how completely trivial it is? Two hundred years from now you, I and every person now living in the galaxy will be dead. What does it matter if a few of them are helped along and reach their destination a bit quicker? They'd do the same to you if they had the chance.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"You're wrong,",James diGriz,Angelina
18,"Why did you do it, Jim?",Angelina,James diGriz
18,Why did you want to do it?,Angelina,James diGriz
18,"You didn't do anything,",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"I did it myself because I let myself believe that one man could be any different from the others. You have taught me a valuable lesson, and out of gratitude I will kill you quickly, instead of in the way I would much prefer.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"What the hell are you talking about,",James diGriz,Angelina
18,"Don't play the innocent to the very end,",Angelina,James diGriz
18,That was the radar post. I installed the equipment myself and have the operators bribed to give me first notice. A ring of ships—as you well know—has dropped from space and surrounded this area. Your job was to keep me occupied so I wouldn't notice this. The plan came perilously close to succeeding.,Angelina,James diGriz
18,If I told you I was innocent—gave you my most sincere word of honor—would you believe me?,James diGriz,Angelina
18,I have nothing to do with this and know nothing about it.,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"Hooray for the Boy Space Scout,",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"Why don't you admit the truth, since you will be dead in twenty seconds no matter what you say.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,I've told you the truth.,James diGriz,Angelina
18,"Good-by, James diGriz. It was nice knowing you—for a while. Let me leave you with a last pleasant thought. All this was in vain. There is a door and an exit behind me that no one knows about. Before your police get here I shall be safely gone. And if the thought tortures you a bit, I intend to go on killing and killing and killing and you will never be able to stop me.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"Spare me the histrionics, Jim,",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"I wouldn't expect that kind of juvenile trick from you, staring over my shoulder and widening your eyes as if there were someone behind me. I'm not going to turn and look. You're not getting out of this one alive.",Angelina,James diGriz
18,"Famous last words,",James diGriz,Angelina
19,"Have a drink,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"Ersatz terran brandy, not this local brand of plastic solvent.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"Drop dead, you....",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,Is that any kind of language to use on your superior officer in the Special Corps?,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,It's a good thing we're a relaxed organization without too many rules. Still—there are limits.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Why did you do it?,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"Because you didn't, that's why. The operation is over, you are a success. Before you were merely on probation, but now you are a full agent.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"I hereby appoint you a Full Agent of the Special Corps,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,by authority of the power vested in me.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"I thought I was no longer a member of the crew,",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"I never received your resignation,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Not that it would have meant anything. You can't resign from the Corps.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Yeah—but I got your message when you gave me a discharge. Or did you forget that I stole a ship and you set off the scuttling charge by remote to blow me up? As you see I managed to pull the fuse just before it let go.,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"Nothing of the sort, my boy,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,You were so insistent about looking for the fair Angelina that I thought you might want to borrow a ship before we had a chance to assign you one. The one you took had the fuse rigged as it always is on these occasions. The fuse—not the charge—is set to explode five seconds after it is removed. I find this gives a certain independence of mind to prospective agents who regret their manner of departure.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,You mean—the whole thing was a frame-up?,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"You might say that. I prefer the term 'graduating-exercise'. This is the time when we find out if our crooked novices really will devote the rest of their lives to the pursuit of law and order. When they find out, too. We don't want there to be any regrets in later years. You found out, didn't you Jim?",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"I found out something ... I'm not quite sure what yet,",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,It was a fine operation. I must say you showed a lot of imagination in the way you carried it out.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"But that business with the bank, I can't say I approve of it. The Corps has all the funds you will need....",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"Same money,",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"Where does the Corps get it? From planetary governments. And where do they get it from? Taxes of course. So I take it directly from the bank. The insurance company pays the bank for the loss, then declares a smaller income that year, pays less taxes to the government—and the result is exactly the same as your way!",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,How did you find me?,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,There was no bug on the ship.,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"Simple child of nature that you are,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"Do you really think that any of our ships aren't bugged? And the job done so well it cannot be detected if you don't know where to look. For your information the apparently solid outer door of the spacelock contains quite a complex transmitter, strong enough for us to detect at quite a distance.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Then why didn't I hear it?,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"For the simple reason that it wasn't broadcasting. I should add that the door also contains a receiver. The device only transmits when it receives the proper signal. We gave you time to reach your destination and then followed you. We lost you for a while in Freiburbad, but picked up your trail again in the hospital, right after you played musical chairs with the corpses. We lent you a hand there, the hospital was justifiably annoyed but we managed to keep them quiet. After that it was just a matter of keeping an eye on doctors and surgical equipment since your next move was obvious. I hope you'll be pleased to know that you are carrying a very compact little transmitter in your sternum.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"It was too good an opportunity to miss,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,One night when you were under sedation the good doctor found the alcohol we had seen fit to include in one of your supply packages. He of course took advantage of this shipping error and a Corps surgeon made a little operation of his own.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Then you have been following me and watching ever since?,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"That's right. But this was your case, just as much as it would have been if you knew we were there.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Then why did you move in for the kill like this?,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,I didn't blow the whistle for the marines.,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"It's like this,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"I like a new man to have enough rope. But not so much that he will hang himself. You were here for what might be called a goodly long time, and I wasn't receiving any reports about revolutions or arrests you had made.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Would you have arrested her if we hadn't moved in?,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"I don't know,",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"Well I damn well knew what I was going to do,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,So I did it. The plot is well nipped before it could bud and our multiple murderess is offplanet by now.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Let her go!,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,Let her go I tell you!,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,Would you turn her loose again—the way she is?,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"This has been a rough assignment for you,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,At times there can be a very thin line between right and wrong. If you are emotionally involved the line is almost impossible to see.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,What will happen to her?,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"The truth—for a change,",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"All right, the truth. No promises—but the psych boys might be able to do something with her. If they can find the cause of the basic aberration. But that can be impossible to find at times.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,Not in this case—I can tell them.,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"In that case there might be a chance. I'll give positive orders that everything is to be tried before they even consider anything like personality removal. If that is done she is just another body, of which there are plenty in the galaxy. Sentenced to death she's just another corpse—of which there is an equal multitude.",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"I know you Inskipp,",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,You're a born recruiting sergeant. When you lick them—make them join.,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,"What else,",Inskipp,James diGriz
19,She'd make a great agent.,Inskipp,James diGriz
19,"We'd make a great team,",James diGriz,Inskipp
19,Here's to crime.,James diGriz,Inskipp
19,Here's to crime.,Inskipp,James diGriz
